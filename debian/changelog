case-organizer (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added Case Law upload flow that stores judgments within a dedicated
    hierarchy, captures mandatory metadata, and writes companion notes.
  * Integrated automatic text extraction (PDF/TXT/DOCX) with a SQLite FTS5
    index to power boolean/proximity search over uploaded case law.
  * Introduced SCCOnline-style Case Law search UI with filters, boolean syntax, and
    note editing directly from results.
  * Made directory search toggleable so users can return to previous results.
  * Ensured note modal preserves paragraph breaks and works cleanly in both
    light and dark themes.
  * Fixed case-law search radio controls so they respect theme changes.
  * Synced the Debian payload with the refreshed 1.2.0 source tree.
  * Declared new runtime dependencies for pdfminer.six and python-docx so
    packages ship the required extraction stack.
